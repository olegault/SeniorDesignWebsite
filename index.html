                <h4 class="mb-5">ABOUT US</h4>              
                <h5 class="mb-5">Code V Wade is an open-source platform that informs users of reproductive health apps (such as period trackers or fertility applications) how well they protect their privacy. We generate a privacy score for each app from 0 to 100, which we calculate based on a mixed-methods analysis of the application's data protection. 
                    Our score is accompanied by an in-depth breakdown of specific metrics for measuring user privacy, as well as a short summary of the app's privacy policy. All of this information is available at codevwade.org, where you can 
                    search through our database of analyzed apps or submit a new app to be scored. For tools, we used AWS to host our website with Django for the frontend UI. Our scraping was conducted with the google-play-scraper and we apply mitmproxy for network analysis.
